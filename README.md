A very petty program: Find the people that don't follow you back on Instagram.

You have to download your personal data from the non-mobile Instagram website. 
Go to instagram.com, click on your profile icon, click on the gear next to "Edit Profile", click Privacy & Security,
go down to Data Download, and click Request Download. The Data Download (anecdotally) doesn't take too long, just about 5 min.
